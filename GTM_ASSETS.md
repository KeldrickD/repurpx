## 1. Cold DM Scripts (Twitter/X, IG, Telegram)

### Target: OnlyFans Creators (Top 1-5%)
**Hook:** "Your DMs are a mess" -> "Revenue engine"

> **Subject/First line:** your fans are begging to pay you lol
>
> Hey [Name], been following your growth, crazy numbers. 📈
>
> Quick q—how are you handling the ghosts in your DMs? Most creators I talk to are leaving like $5k/mo on the table just because they can't segment "whales" from "time wasters" fast enough.
>
> I built a tool (RepurpX) that auto-sorts your fans into Whales, New, and Ghosts so you can mass-DM them with different scripts. No agency needed.
>
> Want to try it free? I'll set you up with a VIP account.

### Target: Dancers / Entertainers
**Hook:** "Shift ROI" -> "Text your regulars"

> **Subject/First line:** making your next shift 2x easier
>
> Hey [Name], love the content.
>
> Random question—do you have a way to text all your regulars before you head into the club?
>
> I built a simple "Dancer CRM" that tracks your VIPs and lets you blast them (e.g. "I'm on the floor tonight") in one click without using your personal number.
>
> It’s free to start. Want to see how it works?

### Target: Club Owners / Promoters
**Hook:** "Slow nights" -> "Automated VIPs"

> **Subject/First line:** filling tables on slow nights
>
> [Name] — quick question. When you have a slow Thursday/Sunday, how do you reach your VIP list?
>
> I noticed most venues just rely on promoters or IG stories. We built a system that auto-texts your top spenders when it's their birthday week or if they haven't visited in 30 days.
>
> Clubs using it are seeing +20% return visits. Open to a 5-min demo?

## 4. 60-Second Demo Script (Club/Dancer focus)

**(Open Dashboard)**

"This is RepurpX. It's not a spreadsheet, it's a money-printer."

**(Click 'Club CRM' or 'Dancer CRM')**

"Here is your VIP list. We don't just list names; we score them.
See this badge? 'Whale'. See this one? 'At Risk'.
This guy hasn't been in for 45 days. That's lost revenue."

**(Click 'Text your VIPs')**

"Usually, getting him back takes 10 minutes of awkward texting.
With RepurpX, I click here. I choose 'Win-back'.
The AI writes a text: *'Hey Josh, been a minute. Come through tonight and cover is on me.'*
I hit send."

**(Pause)**

"I just reached out to 50 people in 10 seconds. If two show up and buy a bottle, this software paid for itself for the next 5 years.
That's it. Do you want to try it?"
